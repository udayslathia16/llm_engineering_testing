       "\n",
       "The _Large Language Model_ (LLM) Wikipedia page provides a comprehensive overview of large language models, which are advanced computational models designed specifically for natural language processing (NLP). Here’s a summary of the key sections:\n",
       "\n",
       "## Key Sections\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. Definition and Functionality\n",
       "LLMs are a type of artificial neural network that performs various tasks related to natural language, such as language generation, by learning from vast datasets. They utilize a transformer-based architecture that processes text efficiently and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. History\n",
       "The development of LLMs has evolved significantly from earlier statistical models to current architectures, such as transformers introduced in 2017. Key milestones include the introduction of models like BERT, GPT-2, and GPT-3, each building on previous capabilities.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. Dataset Preprocessing\n",
       "Training LLMs involves several steps:\n",
       "- **Tokenization**: Converting text into numerical format.\n",
       "- **Dataset Cleaning**: Removing undesirable data from the training sets.\n",
       "- **Synthetic Data**: Generating additional training data when necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. Training and Architecture\n",
       "LLMs are trained using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and instruction tuning. The architecture generally relies on mechanisms like attention to understand context better.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. Properties and Evaluation\n",
       "The page discusses various emergent properties of LLMs, including their ability to exhibit behavior not explicitly programmed, and how their performance is evaluated through perplexity and various standard benchmarks.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. Wider Impact\n",
       "The implementation of LLMs has societal implications, including risks of misinformation, algorithmic bias, and potential industry disruption. The text notes a significant projected impact on global GDP due to generative AI applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 7. List of LLMs\n",
       "The page includes a list of notable LLMs, detailing their parameters, training costs, and other specifications, demonstrating the diverse landscape of models currently available.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "This Wikipedia page serves as an extensive source of information about large language models, touching on their definitions, historical context, methods of training, evaluation metrics, and broader societal implications. It emphasizes the transformative potential of these models in various fields while also highlighting the challenges and risks associated with their deployment."
